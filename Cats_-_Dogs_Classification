Cat and dog classification using Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests involves applying different machine learning algorithms 
to distinguish between images of cats and dogs based on features extracted from the images.
Logistic Regression: This is a linear model used for binary classification. In cat and dog classification, 
the algorithm attempts to draw a decision boundary based on the extracted features (e.g., pixel values or engineered features) to predict whether an image is a cat or a dog. 
However, since Logistic Regression is linear, it may struggle with complex patterns in image data.
Decision Trees: This is a non-linear model that splits the data based on feature values at each node, creating branches that lead to a classification outcome (cat or dog). 
The model continues splitting until it reaches a leaf node, which represents a final decision. Decision Trees are flexible and can handle more complex data patterns 
but are prone to overfitting.
Random Forest: This is an ensemble learning method that improves upon Decision Trees by creating multiple decision trees (a "forest") 
and combining their predictions. Each tree in the forest is trained on a random subset of the data, and the final classification (cat or dog) is determined by majority voting. 
Random Forest is more robust and less likely to overfit than individual decision trees, making it a powerful approach for image classification tasks.
